1. How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I typically start by understanding the requirements and constraints of the problem I'm solving. I break the project down into smaller, manageable parts and define the goals of each part. Then, I create high-level designs, often using flowcharts or UML diagrams, to visualize the system’s architecture. From there, I move on to coding, starting with the most essential parts and building incrementally. As I develop, I ensure that the software is modular and scalable, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.

2. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this project has helped me develop skills in object-oriented design, modular programming, and handling complex visual interactions. I learned to break down larger problems into manageable modules that can be worked on independently. Additionally, I honed my skills in collision detection and game loop design, which are important for interactive software development.

3. What design process did you follow for your project work?
For this project, I followed an iterative design process. Initially, I gathered requirements and established the core functionality. I then created a rough prototype with basic collision detection and ball movement, and iterated on that by adding more features like destructible bricks and ball resizing. Throughout the project, I tested each new feature to ensure it worked as expected and refined the design by gathering feedback from the code’s behavior and making adjustments.

4. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The modular approach I used can be applied to any future project, especially those that require scalability or extensibility. By dividing complex tasks into manageable parts, I can focus on individual components without losing sight of the bigger picture. This approach will also help in team-based environments, where each team member can work on different components independently.

5. How do I approach developing programs?
I approach program development with a focus on understanding the problem, planning my solution, and writing clean, efficient code. I prioritize creating functional prototypes first, then improve them by refactoring and optimizing based on testing. I also ensure that my code is well-documented and easy to understand, so others (or I, in the future) can maintain or extend it.

6. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
In the 3D scene project, I applied strategies related to optimizing graphics rendering and working with physics for object collisions. I also worked on structuring the code to handle multiple objects interacting with one another, ensuring that performance wasn’t impacted by an increasing number of objects in the scene. I learned how to integrate libraries like OpenGL into the development process for real-time graphics and collision detection.

7. How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a central role in my development process. I started with a basic version of the program and continuously tested and improved the functionality. This allowed me to identify bugs and performance issues early, refine the design incrementally, and ensure that new features didn’t break existing ones. This iterative process ensured steady progress toward the final goal.

8. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Throughout the milestones, I became more focused on efficient code organization and testing. Initially, I was more concerned with just getting features to work. But as the project progressed, I refined my code structure, focused on improving performance, and made sure the code was modular and reusable. I also made use of debugging tools more effectively to catch issues earlier in the development process.

9. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science equips me with the skills to solve complex problems using logical thinking, programming, and technology. It provides a strong foundation for entering a wide variety of fields, from software development to data science to machine learning. The analytical and problem-solving skills I gain from studying computer science are invaluable in tackling challenges, whether in personal projects, academic work, or professional career development.

10. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations help develop a deeper understanding of how data can be represented and manipulated in visual forms. They enhance problem-solving skills, allowing me to translate abstract concepts into tangible representations, such as 3D models or animations. These skills are critical in many fields, such as engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence, and will benefit me in future educational paths that involve advanced mathematics or computational tasks.

11. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
In my future professional pathway, computational graphics and visualizations will be essential for industries that rely on design, simulation, or data analysis. Fields like gaming, virtual reality, and machine learning require the ability to create immersive environments and visualize complex data patterns. The knowledge gained through working with graphics will allow me to tackle real-world challenges by designing effective visual solutions and developing user-friendly interfaces for technical problems.
